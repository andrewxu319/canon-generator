INPUT CHECKS
- Each measure must have the same key signature

RANDOM NOTES
- when calculating number of valid bass voices, subtract the number of non invertible voice pairs
- slowest part seems to be generating the xml/part data

TODO
- consonant fourths
- simultaneous dissonances

- delete empty voices (e.g. if max_voices = 3 but only 2-part canons found)
- "versatility" score
- enums for interval names
- augmented & diminished intervals are dissonant
- make message a class so it can take an optional number of parameters
- consecutive octaves w consonant suspensions between them is acceptable https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-4dw1T3v30 3:26
- use texture objects instead of multiple parallel arrays

7-8 in lower voices are an error

PLANNING
- read musicxml---each voice is an ARRAY OF PITCHES with duration = shortest note
  - read one voice only
  - include info on whether pitch is TIED (or use separate array)
- second voice is an array with same starting point, shifted back
  - check counterpoint happens after full texture is generated
- transposition
  - have list of pitches in major & minor key
  - transpose the list according to key
  - find next number down for each note transposed
  - (later) chromatic notes---dont use list
- check counterpoint---compare each item in the two arrays---check for legal intervals
  - one array labeled as bass---"if bass, mark as illegal"
  - if dissonant, check next interval(s). check leaps/steps. have specific formulas. probably nested if statements
  - dont flat out reject---under x number of illegalities is allowed
  - WAIT maybe make array of differences (intervals between the two), then make library of allowable interval sequences (still need to check source for parallels etc)
    - remove duplicates in ORIGINAL arrays (if both arrays repeat)
    - construct rhythmic hierarchy array (LATER bc u then need to consider different rhythmic possibilities. maybe j shift by one cycle)
  - if something only works for inner voices or not against the bass, mark the follower(s) as inner voices or upper voices
- if 3 or more voices---check each pair
- write back into musicxml---add generated voices

classes
- all voices: "texture"
- two voices: "pair"

make texture in xml?
